    "couchFirParFirText": "Coaching is a development process through which coach helps an individual (client) to achieve their goal. International Coaching Federation defines coaching as partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. The process of coaching often unlocks previously untapped sources of imagination, productivity and leadership.",
    "couchSecParFirText": "Together coach and client explore client’s goals and dreams and their capacity to attain those dreams and achieve those goals. Coach is focusing on client’s strength and helps their clients to overcome the obstacles that holding them back from achieving those goals. Coach is non-judgmental, supportive and views their client as partner.",
    
    "couchFirParSecText": "Coach doesn’t give advises. They help their clients by asking thought-provoking questions, so clients can find answers and solutions themselves. Coach holds their clients accountable and keeps record of their progress.",
    "couchSecParSecText": "Coach sometimes helps to reshape their clients’ dreams and goals, as sometimes people set goals and dream in authentically, unaware of their true needs and desires. Coach’s duty is to help their client to find their truth and build their life authentically. Coach speaks only truth. Coach offers integrity, flexibility and trust. Coaching is confidential and requires commitment and respect from both parties.",

    "philosFirParFirText": "Hello, in this portion of the website, you will have an opportunity to get to know me better as a person and as a coach. My path, geographically speaking has taken me through different continents and each offered life-changing experiences.",
    "philosSecParFirText": "Growing up in a loving and traditional Azerbaijani family I was fortunate enough to experience a personal renaissance after moving to the United States, to New York City to be more precise. If I had to describe New York in a short manner, I’d say that it is a place that lacks mercy and consequentially offers unfiltered truth, for which I am very grateful.",
    "philosThirdParFirText": "Being a Medical Doctor paved the beginning of my path in New York. Experiencing a healthcare system of post-socialistic and then capitalistic societies gave me a unique outlook on my profession and life in general. I understood that the way medicine is being practiced in the US, wasn’t the way I wanted to practice it. I disagreed with the lack of holistic approach of the system. I knew that human beings are not merely a sum of biochemical processes that occur within their bodies. I knew there is more than meets the eye.",

    "philosFirParSecText": "Disagreement is often an opportunity where one can look for new pathways towards growth. I took the chance. A long and arduous search that braved many amazing professional, and educational experiences, ended with the discovery of Coaching. After becoming a Life and Executive Coach, and working in New York, I chose to travel to Africa. This trip was nothing less than revolutionary. I was transported from a concrete jungle representing human ambition to the vast and magnificent Sahara that commanded humility.",
    "philosSecParSecText": "We often think that the ocean is vast, but the desert has its own way of vastness that makes you feel insignificant and yet content with that role. Encountering Saharan nomads that lived by unforgiving rules and laws of the desert, made me realize that we all in the modern world are consumed and owned by what we call progress. Moving throughout the desert with a minimal number of personal belongings, these people accept her reign and live with much more integrity and alignment than many of us in the modern world. This was a great humility lesson.",
    "philosThirdParSecText": "There are a few life events and experiences that affected and shaped me as a person and as a coach. Needless to say, that I bring all of it to my practice with the goal to serve people, as coaching for me is an opportunity to work with people’s minds and hearts. The physical aspect of life is undeniable, but we often forget that the main portion of it is being controlled by our choices.",

    "philosFirParThirdText": "Today’s science proves that our physical body listens to commands of our mind. The way you think is in direct correlation with the way your body decides to feel sleepy, anxious, joyous or calm. I help my clients to change how their brain functions by implementing techniques based on currently available scientific knowledge.",
    "philosSecParThirdText": "My job, whether it be Executive or Life Coaching, is to help my clients to gain new skills, and new emotional and intellectual habits that will help them to change their life. I wholeheartedly believe that anyone can achieve the highest goals and change their life.",
    "philosThirdParThirdText": "It is never late and it is always a good time to start doing it. Picasso famously said “It takes a long time to become young.” I say it takes as long as it takes for you to start. Just start."
