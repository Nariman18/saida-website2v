            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>Hello, in this portion of the website, you will have an
opportunity to
get to know me better as a person and as a coach. My path,
geographically speaking has taken me through different
continents and each offered life-changing experiences.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>Growing up in a loving and traditional Azerbaijani family I
was fortunate enough
to experience a personal renaissance after moving to the
United States,
to New York City to be more precise. If I had to describe
New
York in a short manner, I’d say that it is a place that lacks
mercy
and consequentially offers unfiltered truth, for which I am
very grateful.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200] decoration-1 decoration-gray-300'>Being a Medical Doctor paved the beginning of my path in
New
York. Experiencing a healthcare system of post-socialistic
and then
capitalistic societies gave me a unique outlook on my
profession
and life in general. I understood that the way medicine is
being
practiced in the US, wasn’t the way I wanted to practice it.
I
disagreed with the lack of holistic approach of the system.
I knew
that human beings are not merely a sum of biochemical

processes that occur within their bodies. I knew there is
more
than meets the eye.</p>

            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>Disagreement is often an opportunity where one can look
for
new pathways towards growth. I took the chance. A long
and arduous search that braved many amazing
professional, and educational experiences, ended with the
discovery of
Coaching. After becoming a Life and Executive Coach, and
working in New York, I chose to travel to Africa. This trip
was nothing less than revolutionary. I was transported
from a concrete jungle representing human ambition to
the vast and magnificent Sahara that commanded
humility.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>We often think that the ocean is vast, but the desert has its
own way of vastness that makes you feel insignificant and
yet content with that role.
Encountering Saharan nomads that lived by unforgiving
rules and laws of the desert, made me realize that we all in
the modern world are consumed and owned by what we
call progress. Moving throughout the desert with a
minimal number of personal belongings, these people
accept her reign and live with much more integrity and
alignment than many of us in the modern world. This was
a great humility lesson.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200] decoration-1 decoration-gray-300'>These are a few life events and experiences that affected
and shaped me as a person and as a coach. Needless to say,
that I bring all of it to my practice with the goal to serve

people, as coaching for me is an opportunity to work with
people’s minds
and hearts. The physical aspect of life is undeniable, but
we often
forget that the main portion of it is being controlled by our
choices.</p>

            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>Today’s science proves that our physical body
listens to commands of our mind. The way you think is in
direct correlation with the way your body decides to feel
sleepy, anxious, joyous or calm. I help my clients to change
how their brain functions by implementing techniques
based on currently available scientific knowledge.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200]'>My job,
whether it be
Executive or Life Coaching, is to help my clients to gain
new skills, and new emotional and intellectual habits that
will
help them to change their life.
I wholeheartedly believe that anyone can achieve the
highest
goals and change their life.</p>
            <p className='text-[#848484] text-left w-[310px] text-[16px] font-Catamaran font-[200] decoration-1 decoration-gray-300'>It is never late and it is always
a
good time to start doing it.
Picasso famously said “It takes a long time to become
young.”
I say it takes as long as it takes for you to start. Just start.</p>
